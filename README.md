### Description
This MOD will adds few decorations for your industrial buildings.

This mod was created to replace some of the many designs that many users typically use when using the Chisel & Bits mod with one template for performance reasons.   
Due to the nature of the existing chiseled blocks, there was a problem that some performance degradation occurred if too many were placed on the server.


##### ATTENTION: This project is unstable(Not mod itself). Therefore, there is a possibility that development will be delayed too long or no more updated at any time if no more idea or nobody using it.
